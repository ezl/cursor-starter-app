# Trip Creation Process Refactoring

## To-Do List

### Phase 1: Update Landing Page
- [x] Modify landing page form to only ask for destination
  - [x] Remove name field from the landing page form
  - [x] Update form validation to only require destination field
  - [x] Change button text from "Create Trip" to "Start"
  - [x] Update any related JavaScript validation
  - [x] Update route handler to only accept destination 

### Phase 2: Create Second Step Page

  - [x] Add form with name and email fields
  - [x] Add proper validation for both fields
  - [x] Set button text to "Get Recommendations"
  - [x] Add descriptive text: "So your friends know who they're recommending to"
- [x] Create new route to handle the second step
  - [x] Store temporary trip data in session
  - [x] Pass destination from first step to the second step form

### Phase 3: User Management
- [x] Create or modify get_or_create_user function
  - [x] Look up user by email
  - [x] If not found, create new user with provided name and email
  - [x] If found, compare submitted name with existing name
- [x] Handle name resolution
  - [x] If names match, proceed to trip page
  - [x] If names don't match, redirect to name resolution page

### Phase 4: Name Resolution Interface

  - [x] Show contextual message mentioning the trip destination
- [x] Create route handler for name resolution
  - [x] Process user's name selection
  - [x] Update user record with selected name
  - [x] Redirect to trip page after resolution

### Phase 5: Trip Creation Completion
- [x] Modify trip creation process to link trip to user
  - [x] Update database schema if needed to link trips to users
  - [x] Create trip only after user information is confirmed
  - [x] Associate trip with user in the database
- [x] Update trip page to show user's name

### Phase 6: Testing & Deployment
- [x] Write tests for the new flow
  - [x] Test first step form
  - [x] Test second step form
  - [x] Test name resolution
  - [x] Test user creation/association
- [x] Test edge cases
  - [x] User with same email but different name
  - [x] User cancels process midway
  - [x] Form validation errors
- [ ] Deploy changes
  - [ ] Database migrations
  - [ ] Update application code
  - [ ] Test in production environment

## Summary of Implementation

We have successfully implemented a multi-step trip creation process that:

1. Collects the destination on the landing page
2. Gathers user information (name and email) on a second step
3. Manages user identity by checking for existing users with the same email
4. Provides a name resolution interface when there are conflicts
5. Links trips to user accounts in the database

All tests have been updated to reflect the new flow and are passing successfully. The implementation maintains the core functionality while providing a better user experience and collecting more structured user data.

The next steps would be to deploy these changes to production after a final round of manual testing.
